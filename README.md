This is my snake game i made for class and had A lot of fun making! i decided to post here to showcase my game because im very proud of it!.

I used a tutorial https://youtu.be/uzAXxFBbVoE?si=Ka0zAHE4ieOwsPMD for the coding, i referenced their assets folder and tweaked the design to suit my taste.

dowload the download me folder and you will be able to play on a desktop device!!
